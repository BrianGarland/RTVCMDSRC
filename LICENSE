This freeware utility contains the command RTVCMDSRC, which allows you to
retrieve source statements from an AS/400 command into a source file.
Both IBM-supplied and user-defined commands may be retrieved.

A separate command, RTVCMDMSG, is included which retrieves message
descriptions from commands, for PROMPT and CHOICE parameters in which prompt
text was derived from message descriptions when the command was created.
RTVCMDMSG creates source for a CL program containing ADDMSGD commands to
reconstruct a message file with the prompt message descriptions.

The utility will run on V3R1 and up (including RISC) at all QSECURITY levels
up to and including 50.

It is in the public domain and source is included.
